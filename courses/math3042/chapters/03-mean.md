title: Mean (raw & grouped)

A **measure of centre** answers one question: what is a "typical" value of $X$? The mean is the one everyone already knows how to compute; the details that matter are which symbol is which, and what to do when the data arrives already grouped into a frequency table.

## Sample mean vs population mean

$$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum X}{n}$$

$\bar{X}$ (read "X-bar") is the **sample mean** — a **statistic**, computed from $n$ observations you actually collected.

$$\mu = \frac{\sum X}{N}$$

$\mu$ (mu) is the **population mean** — a **parameter**, computed from all $N$ members of the population. Same arithmetic, different scope: $\mu$ is the parameter, $\bar{X}$ the statistic.

## Worked example: ages

Ages in a sample: $22, 19, 20, 22, 35, 19, 21, 23$.

1. Sum: $22+19+20+22+35+19+21+23 = 181$
2. Count: $n = 8$
3. Mean: $\bar{X} = \dfrac{181}{8} = \mathbf{22.625}$

In R: `mean(c(22, 19, 20, 22, 35, 19, 21, 23))` → `22.625`.

:::tip Calculator
Enter these eight ages in your calculator's **STAT mode** as a 1-variable data list; it should read $\bar{x}$ = `22.625`.

```

## Grouped data

Sometimes you don't get the raw values — you get a **frequency table**: how many observations ($f_i$) fell into each group ($i$), where each group is represented by its **class mark** $X_i$ (the midpoint of that group's interval). The grouped mean formula:

$$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum f_i X_i}{\sum f_i}$$

Every observation in a group is treated as if it were exactly at that group's midpoint.

### Worked example: Old Faithful eruption durations

| $X_i$ | 1.75 | 2.25 | 2.75 | 3.25 | 3.75 | 4.25 | 4.75 | 5.25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $f_i$ | 51 | 41 | 5 | 7 | 30 | 73 | 61 | 4 |

1. $\sum f_i = 51+41+5+7+30+73+61+4 = 272$
2. $\sum f_i X_i = 51(1.75)+41(2.25)+5(2.75)+7(3.25)+30(3.75)+73(4.25)+61(4.75)+4(5.25) = 951.5$
3. $\bar{X} = \dfrac{951.5}{272} = \mathbf{3.498}$

```widget
grouped-mean
{ "rows": [[1.75, 51], [2.25, 41], [2.75, 5], [3.25, 7], [3.75, 30], [4.25, 73], [4.75, 61], [5.25, 4]], "title": "Old Faithful eruption durations, grouped" }
```

### Why 3.498 instead of 3.488?

The **raw** (ungrouped) mean of the actual `faithful$eruptions` data is `3.488`; the grouped calculation gives `3.498`. Grouping throws away information: every observation inside a class is replaced by that class's midpoint before you average, so an eruption of 1.90 minutes and one of 1.60 minutes both count as `1.75` if they share a bin. The grouped mean is an **approximation** of the true mean, not a recomputation of it.

## Another grouped example: steel rods

Lab 1's pencil problem 2: rod diameters given as a frequency table (diameter : count) — $10.00\text{mm}\!:\!40$, $10.01\!:\!75$, $10.02\!:\!100$, $10.03\!:\!90$, $10.04\!:\!45$. Here the diameters themselves are the class marks and $\sum f_i = 350$. Working the formula through gives

$$\bar{X} = 10.02071 \text{ mm}$$
